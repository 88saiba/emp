# EM|Panel
## Nginx and MySQL CLI Management Panel

###### This project was inspired by the XAMPP control panel, aiming to provide similar ease of use for managing a EMP stack (Nginx, MySQL, PHP) via a Ruby-based interface.

This Ruby script provides a simple command-line interface for managing Nginx and MySQL services. It allows users to start, stop, check the status of services, and monitor logs. The script operates in a loop, presenting a menu until the user decides to exit.

## Features

- **Start Services**: Enable and start Nginx and MySQL services.
- **Stop Services**: Stop and disable Nginx and MySQL services.
- **Check Configuration**: Verify Nginx configuration files.
- **Check Service Status**: Display the status of Nginx and MySQL services.
- **Monitor Logs**: Continuously monitor access and error logs for Nginx.

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 2.5 or higher recommended)
- `sudo` privileges to manage services
- Nginx and MySQL installed on your system
- Also multitail installed on your system

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (or copy the script to your desired location):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Ensure Nginx and MySQL are installed**:
   Follow the instructions for your specific OS to install Nginx and MySQL.

3. **Run the Script**:

   run the script using command:
   ```bash
   ruby emp.rb
   ```

## Usage

Once the script is running, you will see the following menu:

```
+===========+
Nginx, Mysql Panel
-------------
EMP-Menu
+===========+
1. Turn On Engine
2. Turn Off Engine
3. Check Preps
4. Check Engine
5. View Logs
0. Bail Out
-------------
Always press 'q' to back menu
+===========+
```

### Options

- **1**: Start Nginx and MySQL services.
- **2**: Stop Nginx and MySQL services.
- **3**: Check Nginx configuration files.
- **4**: Check the status of Nginx and MySQL services.
- **5**: Monitor Nginx access and error logs.
- **0**: Exit the program.

### Navigation

- Press the corresponding number to select an option.
- To return to the main menu from sub-options, press `'q'`.

## Easy Access

For faster access to the management panel, set up an alias in your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`). Add the following line:

```bash
alias empanel="ruby /path/to/emp.rb"
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to the script. After adding the alias, reload your shell profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can start the panel by simply typing:

```bash
empanel
```

## Notes

- If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to manage the services and that Nginx and MySQL are correctly installed.
- The script assumes you are running it in a Unix-like environment (Linux/Mac).
- If you have a different server or relational database management system (RDBMS), feel free to modify the commands within this programâ€™s script. Think of this as just a skeleton with the base logic in place.
